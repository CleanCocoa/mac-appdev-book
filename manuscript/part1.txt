# Part 1: Bootstrapping -- Setting Up the Project, Core Data, and Unit Tests

After a few experiments and a lot of conceptual drawings, I knew where I wanted to go with the Word Counter. I wouldn't start with a blank slate. I think to have existing code to port makes taking Swift for a test drive easier. You never know whether errors are due to a lack of understanding Swift, the new API, or an actual implementation problem.

I dedicate this part to making the switch to Swift and getting everything to run, including:

1. Get Core Data and related tests running
2. Prepare the user interface in its own layer
3. Have tests in place for the app's domain

In the second part, I'll cover the actual application's functionality.

This part is mostly made up of longer notes or journal entries. They aren't meant to tell a coherent story. They are meant to provide a view over my shoulder instead. I hope to include enough details so you can follow easily.
