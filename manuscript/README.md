# How to use this manuscript

This is a [Leanpub](http://leanpub.com) book manuscript. Thus, `Book.txt` is the book index which is used to assemble the finished text from all available fragments. `Sample.txt` is used in a similar fashion to create a sample book preview.

I put each part's introduction and heading in a file beginning with `part-`. That's just a personal preference.

The rest of the files start with [a timestamp ID][id]. This means they are sorted by date of creation, not by appearance in the book. This will almost certainly cause confusion as long as you're not used to a writing approach this much fragmented. If you're curious: I write about the [Zettelkasten method][zk] elsewhere.
