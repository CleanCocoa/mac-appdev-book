## Contributing to the Book Manuscript and Example Project

I believe in empowering people. As a consequence, I also believe in sharing information. That's why I am open-sourcing the whole book plus example code. You can pay for the packaged product and support my writing, but the content will be freely available for every brave soul trying to make sense of Mac app development.

Your feedback is very welcome, and I appreciate pull requests on GitHub for both the manuscript and the example project: if you spot a typo or a code error, help me fix it! You can also open issues on GitHub to request additional "features:" more details, more explanations, more examples.

So feel free to contribute to this book and the overall project via GitHub:

- [Book Manuscript on GitHub](https://github.com/DivineDominion/mac-appdev-book)
- [Project Code on GitHub](https://github.com/DivineDominion/mac-appdev-code)

You can read more about the book project on its [dedicated website](http://cleancocoa.com/books/exploring-mac-app-dev/).

A huge thanks for providing feedback and fixing bugs goes to:

- Jorge D Ortiz Fuentes
- [Stanislaw Pankevich](https://github.com/stanislaw)
