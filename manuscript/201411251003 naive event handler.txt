## Naive Event Handler

Somehow, the `BoxRepository` has to know about the user clicking a button, thus issuing the creation of a new `Box`. `BoxRepository` belongs to the domain, although the concrete `CoreDataBoxRepository` is part of infrastructure. It's part of infrastructure because the domain's clients shouldn't have knowledge about this implementation detail, even less so the domain.

The missing glue is between user interface and the domain. That's the application layer: the premier client to the domain.


### View Controllers don't Have to Belong to the Application Layer

Depending on how you create `NSViewController` subclasses, view controllers either belong to the application layer or to the user interface layer. I tend to write dumb view controllers which belong into the user interface layer, next to custom `NSView`s and Nib files. If view controllers become too clever, it's harder to add features or re-use user interface components. That's why I want to separate the UI from Core Data in the first place.

When view controllers are too dumb to perform interesting actions, they have to delegate this behavior to collaborators.

Think of view controllers as smart views rather than complex controllers. Unlike usual views, they can't display themselves. But they are a facade to other user interface components, taking care of the set-up, layout, and basic event handling.

In other words, view controllers coordinate views to form a more complex user interface component. They aggregate their views's basic events and take care of sending more meaningful events to interested parties.

An event handler in the application layer is an interested party. It understands nothing about buttons and outlines. Instead, it answers questions like "How many `Item`s are there in this `Box`?" and takes care of events like "Create a new `Box`."

Handling events in the application layer instead of the view controller introduces the option to phrase the events in a way suitable to the task. You can refer to the **Ubiquitous Language** of your project to describe these events in code: talk in terms of "create `Box`" instead of "`addBoxButton` clicked".

### Leverage the Delegate Pattern

The delegate pattern is widespread in Apple's own framework. You implement a `NSTableViewDelegate` to handle `NSTableView`-specific events. You also need a `NSTableViewDataSource` to provide (initial) data to the table. The table _asks_ for this information. You don't have to shove it down its throat upon initialization. This way, the table can worry about performance issues like caching table cells and ask for parts of the data at your disposal only.

![Event Handler](images/20141125103816_components--event_handler.jpg)

It's pretty easy to add this to the code there is already.

{linenos=off}
    public protocol HandlesItemListEvents: class {
        func provisionNewBoxId() -> BoxId;
        func provisionNewItemId(inBox boxId: BoxId) -> ItemId;
    }

I tend to phrase protocols this way because it makes the role clear and reads pretty well:

{linenos=off}
    class BoxService: HandlesItemListEvents { /* ... */ }

How to name such **Application Services**?

I favor good names. Back in Java-land, the code was cluttered with `XYZService`s and `ABCManager`s. These nouns don't convey a lot of meaning. It requires knowledge of the **Ubiquitous Language** to come up with better names. Most of the really good names will be found in the domain, though. Even the domain will have services to carry out complex actions.

For example, the Word Counter domain includes a `Recorder` and various `Bookkeeper`s. The former takes care of the various ways to track words (all words, words per application, words in project files) while the latter holds on to the actual data in memory, incrementing counters.

The application layer is going to be pretty thin, so I don't mind resorting to the `XYZService` naming convention for now. I can change names later anyway:

    public class BoxAndItemService: HandlesItemListEvents {
        public func provisionNewBoxId() -> BoxId {
            let repository = ServiceLocator.boxRepository()
            let boxId = repository.nextId()
            let box = Box(boxId: boxId, title: "New Box")
        
            repository.addBox(box)
        
            return boxId
        }
    
        public func provisionNewItemId(inBox boxId: BoxId) -> ItemId {
            //FIXME: this is a stub
            return ItemId(0)
        }
    }
    
The implementation of `provisionNewBoxId` is easy. Provisioning items belonging to boxes will be a bit more intricate.

The functional test still fails because the `BoxAndItemService` is never actually loaded. Whichever object is responsible for creating the window must introduce this event handler to the view controller. Currently, that's the job of `AppDelegate`.

### Wire together existing components

`AppDelegate` sets up the view controller like this:

{linenos=off}
    lazy var windowController = ItemManagementWindowController()
    lazy var boxAndItemService = BoxAndItemService()
    
    func applicationDidFinishLaunching(aNotification: NSNotification) {
        windowController.eventHandler = boxAndItemService
        
        windowController.showWindow(self)
        windowController.window?.makeKeyAndOrderFront(self)
    }

`ItemManagementWindowController` simply passes the `BoxAndItemService` down to the `ItemViewController` which actually needs it.

    @IBAction public func addBox(sender: AnyObject) {
        if let eventHandler = self.eventHandler {
            let boxId = eventHandler.provisionNewBoxId()
            let box = BoxNode(boxId: boxId)
            let indexPath = NSIndexPath(index: nodeCount())
            itemsController.insertObject(box, 
                atArrangedObjectIndexPath: indexPath)
            orderTree()
        }
    }

Now that `addBox(_:)` in `ItemViewController` depends on `eventHandler` being set, the tests have to provide it. The `AddingItemsTests` suite will use the actual `BoxAndItemService`, but the `ItemViewControllerTests` won't. They're unit tests. To make them pass, the unit tests will provide a `NullEventHandler`: a stub to satisfy the dependency.

    class EventHandlerStub: HandlesItemListEvents {
        func provisionNewBoxId() -> BoxId {
            return BoxId(0)
        }
    
        func provisionNewItemId(inBox boxId: BoxId) -> ItemId {
            return ItemId(0)
        }
    }

I would've added `EventHandlerStub` to `ItemViewController` directly as the default value of the `eventHandler` property. This way, I wouldn't need to conditionally unwrap the optional. (I don't like the additional level of nesting.) 

Since `eventHandler` is a weak reference only, it isn't possible to add a placeholder object with "null" behavior in `ItemViewController` directly. [Null Objects][nullobj] are pretty useful to avoid `nil` checks. My utter dislike for what conditionally unwrapping optionals does to my code is a strong motivation to employ Null Objects in Swift. This particular interface is heavy on the _query_ side of CQRS while Null Objects are better suited to stub-out _commands_.

To make the test pass, `CoreDataBoxRepository` needs a `count() -> Int` method:

    public func count() -> Int {
        let fetchRequest = NSFetchRequest(entityName: ManagedBox.entityName())
        fetchRequest.includesSubentities = false
        
        var error: NSError? = nil
        let count = managedObjectContext.countForFetchRequest(fetchRequest, 
            error: &error)
        
        if count == NSNotFound {
            // handle error
            return NSNotFound
        }
        
        return count
    }

Here, still, I don't handle errors. Why is that so? Because I don't have an actual application at my disposal which could respond to anything. I could either `fail()` and stop the application on such errors or implement my own error handling facilities. The latter is what I'll do in part 3.

Now all tests pass: new `Box`es are created and both stored and shown.[^1d4b7c3ffa9fbd71ee7d64e5aacab39446c90acd]
