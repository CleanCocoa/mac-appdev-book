## Objectives Accomplished?

In the introduction, I told you about the learning objectives I had in mind:

1. Your will learn to recognize the core of your application, the Domain, where the business rules belong.
2. Consequently, you will learn how to put your view controllers on a diet and to mentally think of them as a user interface detail.
3. In the end, you'll be comfortable with using your own "POSO"s (Plain Old Swift Objects) instead of looking for a solution in the Cocoa framework.

Now please take a few minutes and answer for yourself a few questions to solidify the new information and to find out where additional information is beneficial.

### Self-Assessment

Please write down your answers in any way you like just to make sure your mind doesn't skip a thing and to enhance the learning effect.

These are the questions I suggest:

* Which were your breakthroughs, your personal Eureka-moments?
* What did you learn about how you write code? 
* What are you comfortable with doing now but couldn't think of earlier?
* Which of the three objectives do you think I did not help accomplish?
* Which opportunity have I missed? What should I have addressed?

Thank you for taking the time to help make this book worth your while!
