# Part 2: Sending Messages Inside of the App

I tried to prepare all of the app's components so far in isolation and not worry much about the integration. In other words, running the app will show that things don't seem to work. The basic structure is in place, but there's virtually no _action._ That's changing in this part. 

The app window is going to look like this:

At the moment, the state of the app is the following:

* The user interface is operational but doesn't persist data. The `ItemViewController` reacts to button presses and creates node objects.
* The Core Data part of infrastructure seems to work fine according to the tests but doesn't receive any commands, yet.
* The domain is particularly boring. It has no behavior at all. Until now, the whole demo application is centered around getting user input to the data store. This will not change until the next part. It's nonsensical to work this way of course when the domain should be the very key component of the application.
* There's no event handling at all, as in "User adds a Box to the list". There's no layer between user interface and domain.

This part will focus on the integration and various methods of passing messages between components of the app. When I figured out the _structure_ of the app in the last sections, now I worry more about designing the _processing_ of information and performang actions. There are a few attractive options to consider:

* Cocoa's classic delegate pattern to obtain objects ("data source") and handle interactions ("delegate")
* Ports & Adapters-style command-only interfaces, adhering to CQRS[^cqrs]
* Leveraging Domain Events (since there's no domain worth speaking of, we'll defer exploring that option to part 3)

We'll look at all of these in detail.

  [^cqrs]: According to "Command--Query Responsibility Segregation" you separate changes (commands) from obtaining data (queries). A method should return a value or cause a change in the system, never both.
