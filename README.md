Develop Mac Apps With a Clean Architecture and Swift
====================================================

This is the book manuscript for "[Develop Mac Apps With a Clean Architecture and Swift][leanpub]".

Outline
-------

* My motivation to document the process
* Part 1: Getting everything ready
    * This part is mostly about making myself comfortable with Swift
    * I port old code to establish a foundation to build upon later
    * Get Core Data and related tests running
    * Prepare the user interface in its own layer
    * Have tests in place for the app's domain
* Part 2: Solving the actual problem
    * my naive take on a DDD solution
* Part 3: Discussing design alternatives
    * where I create alternate branches
